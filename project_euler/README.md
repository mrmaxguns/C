# Project Euler

This section has my solutions for Project Euler found
at [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/).
Each solution has a docstring at the top of the file
explaining the solution in detail. The question for
each problem is also found in the docstring and was
taken from *projecteuler.net*. Each solution is
in a separate folder because I might add multiple
solutions. The format for folder names is `problem_xxx`
and file names is `sol[solution name].c`.
